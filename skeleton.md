1) What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550px? How do you think that works?
When the screen is resized to less than 550px the content stacks on top of itself. For instance, all columns in the grid are reduced to one column across. Some of the information stacks as well. This works because of a media query coded into the CSS which checks if the min-width of a screen is greater than 440px, the width of a phone screen. When the site is opened on a large screen size, the media query activates, creating a broader view.  However, if the screen is then resized to below 440px, the media query deactivates and the mobile default view kicks in. The default view is for mobiles because the CSS is coded to be 'mobile-first'. This optimises performance for small devices.
